# This task is used to create variables used in giving a warning summary for manual tasks
# that need attention
#
# The warn_control_list and warn_count vars start life in vars/main.yml but get updated
# as the tasks that have a warning complete
#
# Those two variables are used in the tasks/main.yml to display a list of warnings
#
# warn_control_id is set within the task itself and has the control ID as the value
#
# warn_control_list is the main variable to be used and is a list made up of the warn_control_idâ€™s
#
# warn_count the main variable for the number of warnings and each time a warn_control_id is added
# the count increases by a value of 1
